## Academic Interests

My name is Anna Kenig-Ziesler, and I am a third year in the College. I am majoring in Public Policy and minoring in Human Rights. I am really interested in better understanding how data can be used to inform public policy, so I am really excited to be taking this course! In the past, I have found that an inability to program can be quite limiting when it comes to data analysis, so I am looking forward to getting an introduction to computing! On campus, I am very involved in UChiVotes, and I am really passionate about getting out the vote this election. While I am unsure of what I want to do career-wise, I would love to work on environmental or civil rights issues in some capacity in the policy world. 

## Outside of Class

Outside of class, a few of *my favorite things* are listed below: 

* Soccer
* Running
* Biking
* Cats (but I love dogs too)
* Healthy (vegan) food
* Dark chocolate
* Outdoors

I am a member of the Women's Soccer team ([Athletics Bio](https://athletics.uchicago.edu/sports/wsoc/2020-21/bios/kenig-ziesler_anna_u8hf)), and I also love to run. I am a little bit of a fitness freak, and I pretty much love any form of working out. I spend pretty much all of the (limited) free time that I have doing something active! One of my favorite things to do in Chicago is to run downtown with friends to get donuts.

I also really love animals, and I have two cats and a dog at home. While I have always been a cat person, dogs have definitely grown on me since we got our dog a few years ago! I really enjoyed being able to spend some more time at home with my pets during quarantine.
