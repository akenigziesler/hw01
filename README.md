![Image of Me](IMG_0909_smaller.jpeg){width=50%}

My name is Anna Kenig-Ziesler, and I am a third year in the College. I am majoring in Public Policy and minoring in Human Rights. I am really interested in better understanding how data can be used to inform public policy, so I am really excited to be taking this course! On campus, I am very involved in UChiVotes, and I am really passionate about getting out the vote this election. While I am unsure of what I want to do career-wise, I would love to work on environmental or civil rights issues in some capacity.

Outside of class, I am a member of the Women's Soccer team, and I also love to run. I am a little bit of a fitness freak, and I pretty much love any form of working out.
